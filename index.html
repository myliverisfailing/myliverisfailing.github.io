<!--

If anyone actually reads through the websites code, I can assure you AI can't write this shit, and it was all written by a human.
For all of the pages its the same idea just with changed titles, texts and images. Im to FAT to go through and comment on all of those individually
The website looks ass, but it functions well enough. It would be deeply appreciated if this shitty website got me a decent grade (achieved at least)
